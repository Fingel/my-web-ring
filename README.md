# my-web-ring

Goals:
    1. I want to follow people I find interesting, mostly those who write
    long form content on blogs.
    2. I want to be able to quickly be exposed to content that I (possibly)
    have not seen before.
    3. I don't want to see out-of-content comments (ala reddit or hn).
    4. I don't want to feel pressure to "keep up" with new content.

Problems with existing solutions:

Hacker News:

Good for it's breadth of content from various places. Bad because it's addictive social
features: karma score, often toxic comments section, increasingly political content.
Good for quickly pulling up during a short break and seeing some new stuff.

Twitter/Mastodon

Good for following a lot of people. S/N is WAY off. Content is often low quality
"gotchya" or clickbaity stuff.

RSS:

Great for following long form content. Bad because it shows you too much. Easy to feel
as if you need to keep up (unread count is toxic). Bad if you want just want to pull
up a quick article during a coding break.


Possible Solutions:

A tool in which I can input RSS feeds (possibly social feeds?) and which with a quick
command (or visit to an address) I am directed to a random(ish?) article or post from
my own curated collection. Like a web-ring or stumbleupon of old, excpet that it's hosted
locally, or at least curated by the user.

Some ideas:
    1. Specify when adding a source if only items from that point onward should be
    displayed or the entire backlog.
    2. It should be extremely easy and fast to add and remove sources. For example, if
    I use the tool and it opens a crappy article and I decide that I'm over that author
    I should be able to just hit a single key to remove the source completely.
    3. Show next button/command if I want to keep going or just skip.
    4. Possible to pull from social posts (mastodon, twitter) if there are some accounts
    that are just good?
    5. Option to not mark a content as read, but to instead place it back in the pool
    (read later).

Problems:
    1. Discoverability. Once nice thing about social media/site like HN is the breadth
    of possible content you are exposed to. I'm less concerned about this than I used to
    be. I've found that good authors tend to use many references. It's possible to discover
    a huge network of people just from reading a few carefully.
    2. Laziness. How to keep your repository from feeling stale/boring? How to keep
    motivated to keep adding sources if the old ones get old?
    3. Fairness. How to prevent prolific authors from dominating the selection algorith,
    it'll have to be a clever algo.
