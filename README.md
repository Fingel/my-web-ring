# My Web Ring

My Web Ring, mwr for short, is a local-first RSS reader that also supports non-feed webpages and youtube channels.
MWR is not a typical RSS reader: launching
`mwr` (or accessing it via http) will open your browser to an unread pseudo-random page.

# Motivation

Tired of doomscrolling on websites like Hacker News, I wondered if there could
be a better way. I came to 3 realizations:

1. Most content I actually care to read is already on blogs that provide feeds.
2. I hate RSS readers.
3. I do most of my exploratory reading during downtime/procrastination.

MWR works for me because it surfaces content pseudo-randomly that I actually
care about. It has completely replaced  doomscrolling for me.

## Why Not an RSS Reader?

I hate how RSS readers tend to make me feel behind: It's too easy for me to see
the unread count and feel like I need to keep up. With MWR there is no pressure to read
everything, and the page selection algorithm still favors newer content (more on that below).


# Page Selection Algorithm

What page you get from MWR when you ask for one is determined by a simple algorithm:

* All sources (feeds or websites) start at weight 10: you can change weight on a source by source basis.
* Newer content is weighted higher than older content.
* Non-feed websites become "unread" each time you launch MWR, also start at weight 10, and have
a "newness" score of 5 days.

# Installation
Binaries are available from the [releases](https://github.com/Fingel/my-web-ring/releases) page.

You may need to install `sqlite3`.

# HTTP interface
MWR includes a simple HTTP server so that you can use it without the terminal (in other words: on your
phone.) Running `mwr server` will start it on port  8090. Accessing the server simply returns redirects to
pages. I may expand this in the future.

# Adding Youtube channels
Youtube channels have secret RSS feeds:

https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<channel_id>

You can find the channel ID by clicking "more" in the channel description,
share channel, copy channel ID.
